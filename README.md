## Work from Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Projects!"

#### This repository hosts all my work from the various coding challenges and projects completed while taking this udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/. 

#### From the course you learn:

* JavaScript and programming fundamentals: variables, boolean logic, if/else, loops, functions, arrays, etc.
* Asynchronous JavaScript: The event loop, promises, async/await, AJAX and APIs
* A true understanding of how JavaScript works behind the scenes
* How to code 3 beautiful real-world apps with both ES5 and ES6+ (no boring toy apps)
* Complex features like the 'this' keyword, function constructors, prototypal inheritance, first-class functions, closures
* Modern JavaScript for 2018: NPM, Webpack, Babel and ES6 modules
* What's new in ES6: arrow functions, classes, default and rest parameters, etc.
* To organize and structure your code using JavaScript patterns like modules

#### It's a great course and I highly recommend it!
